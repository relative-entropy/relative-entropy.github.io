											<h3 class="major">Telecommunications Testing</h3>
											<p>RE Consulting was established as a result of a need to perform independent essential testing on South Africa's telecommunications network performance. This involves the on-site specialised testing of multiple network carriers across a variety of end-user technology levels in the major metropolitan areas across South Africa. RE Consulting is also responsible for monitoring and maintaining the client's specialised equipment used in the project.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Space Exploration Workshops</h3>
											<p>Education and advocacy for space topics are part of our passion. Over the years, Ani has helped organise multiple workshops on space topics all around the world. As a volunteer for the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC), Ani has partnered with ZARM, ESA, NASA SCaN, and others to create and run topical day-long programs both virtually and in-person in Germany, the US, Ethiopia and more. She has won numerous awards for her work.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Research-Based Projects</h3>
											<p>Over the years, Ani has volunteered and consulted on many research-based projects. The most intensive of these was a 2.5-month practical stint at SANAE-IV base in Antarctica. Her work there focused on the installation of new equipment, and maintenance on existing equipment used for Space Science research in Antarctica. Other space projects include the development of mission concepts and feasibility studies for a Lunar Orbiting Telescope, a data-driven oil pipeline monitoring program, and the engineering of an art science payload for the Dreamchaser spacecraft. Non-space research projects have included the optimisation of part production in an aerospace manufacturing facility, and predicting the radiation safety of maintenance workers in a nuclear power plant. </p>

											<h3 class="major">The Pineapple Project</h3>
											<p>The Pineapply Project was born from an attempt to explain to a rural Mauritian farmer why Space Technology was important to everyone, not just scientists. The project, done in conjunction with other space enthusiasts from Mauritius, compared freely available satellite imagery of the farmer's pineapple plantation with ground truthing data collected on-site at the same location. Using basic statistical analysis, the potential crop yield for the plantation was calculated from the satellite imagery, and then compared to an actual count of the pineapple plants growing on the farm. The results were comparable with only a 1.6% difference in count, but many hours of effort saved for just one farmer. The experiment was declared a success.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Space Science Research</h3>
											<p>During her Honours and Masters degree programs, Ani collaborated with the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) to do research into Solar Storms and their effect on Power Networks (GICs) and also into the feasibility of recording Ionospheric Scintillation data using GPS signals from aboard a research vessel in the South Atlantic Ocean. This second body of work formed the majority of her Master's dissertation in Space Studies. The project required an understanding of space physics, GPS satellite technology, radio signals, and data analysis using Matlab and Python. She has developed a good relationship with SANSA as a result of her collaborations. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Local Space Outreach & Education</h3>
											<p> As a lover of all things Space, Ani happily conducts talks on Astronomy and Space at Universities, Schools, NGOs, Science Clubs and STEM Conferences in South Africa. One of her favourite talks was at Greenpeace Africa on satellite applications.</p>
